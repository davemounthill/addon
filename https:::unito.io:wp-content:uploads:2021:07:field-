The file "components/connector/parameters/Parameters.tsx" contains the following function related to the preview table and transformations:

Parameters(): This is the main function of the file, which is a React component. It renders the parameters for the connection. It uses several contexts to get the connection state and validation state. It also uses several functions from the lib and helpers modules to get the parameter, handle changes to the parameter value, and make a label from the suggestion. It then renders a SidebarFieldName component with the label, the Component with the parameter, suggestion, and invalid state, and a ValidationError component if there is a validation error.
The Parameters component could be used to render the parameters for the connection, including the connection name, authentication, date range control, and other parameters.

Next, let's inspect another file.

The file "components/connector/parameters/ParamComponents.tsx" contains the following function related to the preview table and transformations:

ParamComponents(props): This is the main function of the file, which is a React component. It receives a params prop, which is an array of parameter suggestions. It maps each parameter suggestion to a component using the getParameterComponent function from the lib module. If a component is found for the parameter suggestion, it renders a ParamContainer component with the component and the parameter suggestion. If no component is found for the parameter suggestion, it logs a warning and does not render a component for the parameter.
The ParamComponents component could be used to render the components for the parameters of the connection.

Parameters(): Main function of the file, a React component that renders the parameters for the connection.
components/connector/parameters/ParamComponents.tsx

ParamComponents(props): Main function of the file, a React component that maps each parameter suggestion to a component.
components/connector/parameters/ParamContainer.tsx
ParamContainer(props): Main function of the file, a React component that renders a container for a parameter of the connection, including the field name, the parameter component, and a validation error if there is one.
These functions are involved in various aspects of the preview table and transformations, including managing the state and functionality related to the preview feature, rendering the preview table, handling transformations and changes to the transform, handling errors with the connection, refreshing the preview, transforming JSON data to table columns, providing context for thepreview transform, tracking events related to transformations, rendering any component passed to it as a prop, providing an input with select capabilities, rendering the parameters for the connection, mapping each parameter suggestion to a component, and rendering a container for a parameter of the connection.

now I need you to provide me with a design for the sidebar of a Sheets Add-on we are building that its main objective is data mapping between the active sheet and a new one that will be created. 

Use this page for reference on data mapping (have in mind that its for Azure, so from here is only the appliable part): [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto/management/csv-mapping]

Then from the following images obtain ideas on how to structure the layout:

In this github file [templates/sheets-addon/Sidebar.html] belonging to this repo [https://github.com/googleworkspace/apps-script-samples.git] you will find a template for the sidebar.html element in an add-on (which is purely the frontend design part)

So, when you have all these references ready, please create a sidebar design for our data mapping when importing csv files addon. First provide an overview of what should contain, then how it should be structured. Make sure it's a complex system with real-world scenarios in mind. Then, once we agree both, we will transform our vision into the sidebar.html code by writing this file in full as well as creating the Stylesheet.html element if needed. Just so you know, any Javascript element needed on the background will go to the SidebarJavascript.html file 

The idea is to import csv files with crm data  as our use case, any information you may not have think carefully and use your best guess by assuming the potential value. 

Use the plugins for researching online additional ideas, browsing internet, visiting the link I provided and the repo.

The CSV mapping page from Azure provides information on how to map incoming data to columns inside tables when the ingestion source file is in a delimiter-separated tabular format such as CSV, TSV, PSV, SCSV, SOHSV, TXT, and RAW.

Each element in the mapping list defines the mapping for a specific column. These elements are constructed from three properties: column, datatype, and properties. Each CSV mapping element must contain either the ordinal property, which is the column order number in CSV, or the constvalue property, which is the constant value to be used for a column instead of some value inside the CSV file.

For TXT and RAW formats, only ordinal 0 can be mapped as text is treated as a single column of lines. If the table does not exist in the database, then a valid datatype must be specified for all the columns in the mapping. If the columns in the mapping do not exist in the table, then a valid datatype must be specified for all of the non-existing columns.

Now, let's take a look at the images you provided for layout ideas.

The Sidebar.html file from the Google Workspace Apps Script Samples repository provides a basic structure for a sidebar in a Google Sheets Add-on. Here's the structure:

A paragraph explaining the functionality of the sidebar.
A form group with a label and an input field for the sidebar value.
A button bar with two buttons: "Pull" and "Put".
A status div to display status messages.
A bottom branding section with an image and a text.
Based on this structure and the references you provided, here's a proposed design for the sidebar of your data mapping add-on:

Overview
The sidebar should contain the following sections:

File Upload: This section allows users to upload the CSV file they want to import. It should contain an input field for the file path and a "Browse" button to open the file explorer.

Mapping Configuration: This section allows users to map the columns in the CSV file to the columns in the new Google Sheet. It should contain a dynamic list of mapping fields, each consisting of a dropdown menu for the CSV column, a dropdown menu for the Google Sheet column, and a "Delete" button to remove the mapping field. There should also be an "Add Mapping" button to add a new mapping field to the list.

Transformation Configuration: This section allows users to define transformations for the data. It should contain a dynamic list of transformation fields, each consisting of a dropdown menu for the Google Sheet column, a dropdown menu for the transformation type, an input field for the transformation parameters, and a "Delete" button to remove the transformation field. There should also be an "Add Transformation" button to add a new transformation field to the list.

Preview and Import: This section allows users to preview the data with the current mapping and transformation configurations and import the data into the new Google Sheet. It should contain a "Preview" button to open a modal dialog with the preview table, a "Refresh" button to refresh the preview, and an "Import" button to import the data.

Structure
The sidebar should be structured as follows:

A div for the File Upload section, containing an input field for the
